# DiscordAI Bot Template 
This is the template based on my SamurAI AI discord bot from one of my channels (using discord.py) relying on openrouter endpoints and using Moonlight 16b-a3b, though you could use anything. Can help with questions coding, and fun! Must add token limits and be helpful assistant. 

##Basically just plug in your openrouter key. And your discord bot key. And pick the model you want.

Might want to get rid of timeout could cause problems. And there was also some problems with something else I forget.

You can replace the model with whichever one you want.

Since discord has a limit of 2000 tokens, this will truncate responses past that and put ...continued. Trigger ai aliased as a1 in deference to US Department of Education.
